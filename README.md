## 🌟 What is CURIO?

**CURIO** is a lightweight, zero-dependency curation workbench that lives in a single standalone HTML file. It allows you to collect, review, tag, rate, and organize software tools, digital assets, documentation, shaders, audio packs, and creative workflows with zero server setup.

Unlike traditional cloud bookmarkers or notes apps, CURIO runs completely on your local machine, persists data in high-capacity **IndexedDB**, and packages backups into clean **`.zip` archives** containing both your structured JSON metadata and actual image files.
